1. Which areas of Manhattan had the largest number of 311 noise complaints? What are some reasons you can think of for these trends?

The areas of Manhattan that had the largest number of complaints are in Lower Manhattan around the low east side, as well as upper manhattan around harlem. Lower manhattan has a high number of partying and music noise complaints, this could be because of the large amounts of students in the area being with multiple colleges situated there. It is also known to be an area with lots of night life and restaurants which all contribute to the number of noise complaints. The harlem area is also know for its parties and other noise issues. THe large amounts of construction also adds to the noise complaints. New buildings are are constantly under construction in New York City and even at night there are necessary constuctions such as infrastructure maintenance which can not be done in the day time due to the possiblity of impeding traffic. 

2. What are some trends you noticed regarding the descriptor for noise complaints?

Music and partying was by far the largest contributor for noise complaints. This is largely due to the urban nature of New York City, as the nightlife is especially prevalent. Barking dogs are mostly found close to or in parks, which is understandable as dog owners would often take their dogs for walks in these area. Construction noises are mostly found in the midtown and downtown areas where constructions mostly take place in NYC, with the constant builing of houses. 

3. How did the additional data and map changed or reinforced your insights from Q(1)?

The additional data was able to show that the downtown area's partying is caused by the large amount of restaurants and especially bars in the area. However, the lack of bars in the uptown area of harlem did surprise me as the area was also prevalent in music and partying. It can be presumed that students contribute a large percentage in the noise, with NYU, Pace, etc... near the downtown area and Columbia in upper manhattan.
